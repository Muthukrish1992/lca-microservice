Linen is derived from flax fiber, and this dataset explicitly represents the market for flax fiber globally. Therefore, it appropriately captures the supply chain and transportation of raw flax fiber, which is the direct precursor material for linen textiles.

Scope (A1 + A2 coverage):
The dataset describes a market activity, which:

Starts at the gate of flax fiber production (A1: raw material extraction and processing into fiber)

Includes transportation from producers to consumers globally (A2: transport to market)

Therefore, this dataset effectively provides cradle-to-market (A1 + A2) inventory for raw flax fiber supply, aligning with the life cycle inventory boundary you require for cradle-to-gate analysis of linen materials.

Impact results example:
It reports a GWP100 of approximately 1.38 kg CO‚ÇÇe per kg flax fiber delivered globally, reflecting global average transport and sourcing conditions.

‚úÖ Conclusion:
This dataset is a strong and representative proxy for modeling A1 + A2 stages of linen raw material supply in cradle-to-gate LCA for furniture, interior fit-outs, and catering contexts.",,,,,,

Chemically, it is a linear organosilicon compound, consisting of repeating silicon-oxygen (Si‚ÄìO) backbone chains with methyl groups attached.
Relation between PDMS and ""silicon"":
In everyday product and material classification, ""silicon"" is sometimes loosely used to refer to ""silicone,"" which is a family of polymeric materials derived from silicon.
PDMS is a silicone, not elemental silicon (Si) or metallurgical silicon.
PDMS is the main building block of flexible silicone rubbers, sealants, elastomers, coatings, gaskets, etc.
:gear: Relevant properties of PDMS that justify its use as a proxy for ""silicone"" materials:
:white_check_mark: Key properties:
High flexibility and elasticity (ideal for non-structural parts such as seals and cushions).
Good thermal stability and resistance to degradation at high temperatures.
Water repellence and chemical inertness (important for catering and interior fit-out applications).
Biocompatibility and ease of molding into shapes.
:white_check_mark: Applications:
Non-slip pads for furniture legs.
Flexible seals and gaskets for furniture and interior components.
Protective coatings and adhesives in fit-outs.
Bakeware, kitchen utensils in catering applications.
:bell: Conclusion:
When your material category refers to ‚Äúsilicon‚Äù in this context, you are almost certainly referring to silicone elastomers, not elemental silicon metal.
 Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is the most common and appropriate representative material for modeling silicone rubber and elastomer applications.
