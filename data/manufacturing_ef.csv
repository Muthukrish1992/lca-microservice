Rest-of-World,Plastic,Polyvinyl Butyral (PVB),laminating with PVB via autoclave,EPD,"In the A3 stage, PVB is laminated between glass sheets through a heat and pressure process. After initial bonding with heated rollers, the assembly is autoclaved at high temperature to fuse the layers. This autoclave step is energy-intensive and drives most of the A3 emissions. Though PVB is a small mass fraction, it significantly contributes to A3 impact due to the processing demands.","In the A3 manufacturing stage of laminated glass, the Polyvinyl Butyral (PVB) interlayer plays a central role in the lamination process. PVB sheets are placed between layers of flat glass and initially bonded through a pre-lamination step using heated rollers to remove air and ensure alignment. The assembly is then transferred to an autoclave, where it undergoes high-temperature (typically 130‚Äì150 ¬∞C) and high-pressure treatment to permanently bond the glass and PVB layers. This autoclaving process is energy-intensive and constitutes the most significant contributor to A3-stage emissions. Following lamination, the glass edges are trimmed, and the finished product is packaged using materials like plastic film, cardboard, and wooden supports. Although PVB represents a small portion of the product‚Äôs mass, it is responsible for a disproportionately high share of the A3 environmental impact due to the thermal and mechanical demands of the bonding process.",1," Dataset Source:
From the EPD for ≈ûi≈üecam laminated glass (S-P-04818)0:
Declared unit: 1 m¬≤ of laminated glass = 15 kg total
Raw material share:
Flat glass: 97‚Äì99%
PVB: 1‚Äì3%
For calculation, we use PVB = 0.08 kg per 2.5 kg (as per your earlier data), so PVB = 3.2% of total mass.
A3 GWP Total for 1 m¬≤ Laminated Glass:
A3 (Manufacturing only) = 5.5 kg CO‚ÇÇe (from total A1‚ÄìA3 of 19.1 kg CO‚ÇÇe, assuming 29% of impact is A3, as estimated in prior calculations from breakdown logic).
Mass Share Basis:
If PVB is 0.08 kg per 2.5 kg of product, then:
Per kg of product: 0.08 / 2.5 = 0.032 kg PVB
So, 1 kg PVB is equivalent to 31.25 kg product
Scale GWP to 1 kg of PVB:
Multiply the A3 GWP per kg of product by the product mass equivalent:
A3 GWP per kg of laminated glass = 5.5 / 15 = 0.367 kg CO‚ÇÇe
A3 GWP per 1 kg PVB = 0.367 √ó 31.25 = 11.47 kg CO‚ÇÇe
‚úÖ Final Result
A3 GWP for 1 kg of PVB = ~11.5 kg CO‚ÇÇe

First, total A1‚ÄìA3 GWP-GHG per m¬≤ = 6.61 kg CO‚ÇÇ-eq

Then, estimate share of A3 within A1‚ÄìA3:

The raw materials are initially combined in a mixer, where elevated temperature and pressure from a piston help blend the components. The resulting mixture is then transferred to a rolling mill, where it is cooled and shaped into rolls.

A2        5.00E-03 = 0.005
A3        4.97E-01 = 0.497

‚úÖ A3-only CO‚ÇÇe per m¬≤ = 0.497 kg CO‚ÇÇe

üìê Convert A3 CO‚ÇÇe to Per-Kilogram Basis (for GT 40.40)
Given:

Mass per m¬≤ = 0.130 kg

A3¬†CO‚ÇÇe¬†per¬†kg = 0.497
¬†kg¬†CO‚ÇÇe¬†per¬†m¬≤ 0.130 ¬†kg/m¬≤
= 3.823 ¬†kg¬†CO‚ÇÇe¬†per¬†kg
A3¬†CO‚ÇÇe¬†per¬†kg= 0.130¬†kg/m¬≤
0.497¬†kg¬†CO‚ÇÇe¬†per¬†m¬≤  = 3.823¬†kg¬†CO‚ÇÇe¬†per¬†kg

‚úÖ Final Answer:
üîπ A3-only CO‚ÇÇe emissions = 0.497 kg CO‚ÇÇe/m¬≤
üîπ A3-only CO‚ÇÇe per kg of GT 40.40 = ~3.82 kg CO‚ÇÇe/kg
